### Breakdown of Markdown elements:

- **Headers** (`#` for main headers, `##` for subheaders, etc.): Used to create the title, sections, and subsections.
- **Bold text** (`**bold**`): Used to highlight important words like SwiftUI, SwiftData, etc.
- **Lists**:
  - **Unordered List** (`-` or `*`): For listing features, tasks, or instructions.
  - **Ordered List** (`1.`, `2.`): For numbered steps, such as instructions or tasks.
- **Code blocks**: For displaying code (such as the clone command). Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to define a block of code.
- **Links**: You can link to other pages or files using `[text](url)`.
